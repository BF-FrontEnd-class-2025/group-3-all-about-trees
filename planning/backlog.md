## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- [ ] As a user, I want the header elements (images and text) to be horizontally
      centered so that the header looks visually balanced.

  - _Given the header section, when the page is loaded, the images and the
    heading should be horizontally aligned using the .centered-items class._

- [ ] As a user, I want a navigation bar with spaced links, a bottom divider,
      and working anchors to navigate easily.

  - _Given the nav with .bottom-divider and .spaced-items, links should be
    spaced, the border should separate sections, and anchors should scroll to
    #summary-info, #main-info, and #extra-info._

- [ ] As a user, I want the summary section to have styled text and proper
      spacing for readability.

  - _Given the #summary-info section, the paragraph should use the fantasy font
    via .fascinating-words and include line breaks.._

- [ ] As a user, I want the aside section to have proper styling, a visually
      distinct shadow effect, and a functional link for additional information.

  - _Given the aside element with the .aside-info class, the content should use
    the monospace font via .aside-text, display an inset shadow, and the link
    should open in a new tab._

- [ ] As a user, I want the article section to display a paragraph and a list of
      external links so I can easily access resources about trees.
  - _Given the article with the ID main-info, the paragraph should explain the
    content, and the ul with .interesting-things should include functional links
    that open in a new tab._
- [ ] As a user, I want the footer to display evenly spaced links with a top
      divider so I can navigate to external profiles easily.
  - _Given the footer with .top-divider and .spaced-items, the links should be
    horizontally aligned and visually separated by a top border._
