# Constraints

The project should be done purely with HTML and CSS, without relying on
JavaScript.

## External

- **Deadline**: The project must be completed within a strict 2-day deadline,
  which leaves little room for experimentation. Time management will be
  critical, and tasks should be prioritized to ensure core functionality.

- **Content Constraints**: Any content provided must be integrated into the
  project, which may limit flexibility in design.

## Internal

- **Limited Functionality**: Since the project must rely solely on HTML and CSS,
  interactive features such as dynamic content and complex animations will be
  limited using CSS-only techniques.

- **Design Limitations**: Without JavaScript, certain design elements may be
  difficult to implement, requiring alternative approaches such as purely
  CSS-based solutions.
